  - name: risk_score
    description: >
      A continuous score, on a scale of 0 to 1, which indicates the degree of risk
      that a given district faces for flooding. A 1 indicates iminent risk; a 0 indicates
      no risk.
    units: unitless index
    metadata:
      aggregation:
        geospatial: 
          default: average
          allowed: [average, sum, min, max, std]
        temporal: 
          default: average
          allowed: [average, sum, min, max, std]      

parameters:
  # Specify the minimum parameters that should be user-specified to execute a model run
  # Note that each parameter should have a default option provided. 
  # Descriptions for each parameter are optional
  # Each parameter should be on of the following types:
  # - NumberParameter
  # - ChoiceParameter
  # - TimeParameter
  # - GeoParameter
  # - StringParameter
  - name: rainfall_perturbation
    description: >
      The degree to perturb rainfall from the baseline model. This should be a real number, 
      which, if 0, would indicate no rainfall in any district. If 1 it would indicate rainfall
      matching baseline estimates. 1.25 would indicate a 25% increase in rainfall from off the
      baseline estimate.
    metadata:
      # Note: NumberParameter could be a float or integer depending on what the model
      # expects
      type: NumberParameter
    default: 1
    #minimum/maximum values for the parameter [OPTIONAL]
    minumum: 0
    maximum: 50

    description: Select the extent to which deforestation occurs in the forecast area.

      type: ChoiceParameter
      choices:
        - low
        - medium
        - high
    default: low
  - name: time
    description: >
      Choose the time range over which to train the model. Allows for the exclusion
      of extreme or outlier events.
    metadata:
      type: TimeParameter
      # Note: TimeParameter format should be whatever is expected by the model
      # TimeParameter is, therefore, not a specified time format 
    default: 2012-01-01-2019-01-01

    description: Constrain model forecast to a specific geography

      type: GeoParameter
      # Note: the GeoParameter format should be whatever is expected by the model
      # GeoParameter is, therefore, not a specified geo format
