label: Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer
description: The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) comprises
  dynamic crop growth simulation model for over 40 crops. The model simulates growth
  development; and yield as a function of the soil-plant-atmosphere dynamics.

parameters:
- name: season
  description: The season for the given run. May supercede planting_start and planting_end.
  metadata:
    type: ChoiceParameter
    default: meher
    choices:
    - Meher
    - Belg
- name: crop
  description: The crop for the given model run.
  metadata:
    type: ChoiceParameter
    default: maize
    choices:
    - maize   
- name: samples
  description: The number of pixel predictions DSSAT will make. Setting samples to
    0 returns the  entire geography (all Ethiopia) which is quite large.
  metadata:
    type: NumberParameter
    default: 0
    minumum: 1
    maximum: 0
- name: management_practice
  description: 'The management practice to model. rf_highN corresponds to a
    high nitrogen management  practice. irrig corresponds to a high nitrogen,
    irrigated management practice. rf_0N  corresponds to a subsistence management
    practice. rf_lowN corresponds to a low nitrogen  managemet practice. If
    set to combined, all practices are produced. '

    choices:
    - combined
    - rf_highN
    - irrig

- name: start_year
  description: The year to begin the simulation. The earliest possible year to begin
    is 1984 and the latest is  2019.
  metadata:
    type: TimeParameter
    default: 1984
    minumum: 1984
    maximum: 2018
- name: number_years
  description: The number of years to run the simulation. If start_year + number_years
    - 1 > 2018 then this  will be set such that your simulation runs through 2018.
  metadata:
    type: TimeParameter
    default: 35
    minumum: 1
    maximum: 35
- name: rainfall
  description: The degree to perturb rainfall from the baseline model. This should
    be a real number,  which, if 0, would indicate no rainfall in any district. If
    1 it would indicate rainfall matching baseline estimates. 1.25 would indicate
    a 25% increase in rainfall from off the baseline estimate.
  metadata:
    type: NumberParameter
    default: 1
    minumum: 0
    maximum: 2
- name: fertilizer
  description: This a scalar between 0 and 100 which represents fertilizer in kg/ha.
    0 is considered the  baseline amount (per management practice), so anything
    above 0 represents additional fertilizer usage/availability.
  metadata:
    type: NumberParameter
    default: 0
    minumum: 0
    maximum: 100
- name: planting_start
  description: This is the month and day in "mm-dd" format when planting should begin.
    This allows the modeler  to simulate various planting seasons (such as Belg and
    Maher).
  metadata:
    type: TimeParameter
    default: 03-01
    minumum: 01-01
    maximum: 12-31
- name: planting_end
  description: This is the month and day in "mm-dd" format when planting should end.
    This allows the modeler  to simulate various planting seasons (such as Belg and
    Maher). This must be after the  planting_start parameter.
  metadata:
    type: TimeParameter
    default: 05-20
    minumum: 01-01
    maximum: 12-31
- name: planting_window_shift
  description: This is the number, in days, that the planting window was shifted
