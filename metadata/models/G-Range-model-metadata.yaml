id: G-Range
label: APSIMx-G-Range
description: "G-Range is a global rangeland model that simulates generalised changes in rangelands through time. Spatial data and a set of parameters that describe plant growth in landscape units combine with computer code representing ecological processes to represent soil nutrient and water dynamics, vegetation growth, fire, and wild and domestic animal offtake. The model is spatial, with areas of the world divided into square cells. Those cells that are rangelands have ecosystem dynamics simulated. A graphical user interface allows users to explore model output."

  description: One of 5 classes based on the mean 2018-19 cropping-year (March-February) rainfall and temperature anomalies in the climate ensemble member. Ensemble members where the root-mean-square anomaly of temperature and precipitation are within 0.9 standard deviations are "midrange"; otherwise ensemble members are classified according to the quadrant in which they fall. Null for historical runs.

- name: additional_extension
  description: For this scenario, an "extension package" means the adoption of both improved crop cultivars and chemical fertilizer application. The value is the proportion of land **not already using "extension package"** that is converted to management under the "extension package". For example, if 20% of maize crops in a grid-cell already use improved cultivars plus fertilizer, then 40% "additional extension package" will increase the overall level to (20% + 40% x (100%-20%)) = 52%
