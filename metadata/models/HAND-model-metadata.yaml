label: Height Above Nearest Drainage
description: "The Height Above the Nearest Drainage (HAND) is a model that normalizes topography according to the local relative heights found along a given drainage network. Model output shows a high correlation with the depth of the water table in a region and provide an accurate spatial representation of soil water environments. HAND takes as input a Digital Elevation Map of a given region, producing as outputa normalized draining potential (or relative vertical flowpath-distance) to the nearest drainages.
