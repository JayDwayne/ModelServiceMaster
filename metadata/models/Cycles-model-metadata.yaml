description: "Cycles simulates the productivity and the water,carbon and nitrogen balance of soil-crop systems subject to climate conditions and a large array of management constraints. Overall the model is set up to be daily. Some processes such as water balance are temporally nested (subdaily) Emulator page: https://dev.mint.isi.edu/ethiopia/emulators/cycles"
