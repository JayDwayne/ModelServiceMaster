description: 'Version 2.0 estimates of total number of people per grid square for
  five timepoints between 2000 and 2020 at five year intervals; national totals have
  been adjusted to match UN Population Division estimates for each time point.

  This dataset is a mosaic of all WorldPop country level African datasets resampled
  to 1km resolution. The continental grouping of countries honours the macro geographical
  classification developed and maintained by the United Nations Statistics Division.
  For countries within each continental group which have not been mapped by WorldPop,
  GPWv4 1km population count data was used to complete the mosaic. Full details of
  WorldPop population mapping methodologies are described at www.worldpop.org.uk/data/methods/'
