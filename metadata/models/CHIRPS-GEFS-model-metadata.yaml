  Forecast System
description: NCEPâ€™s Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) is a weather forecast system
  that provides daily forecasts out to 16 days at 1 X 1 degree resolution at 6-hour
  intervals. This forecast product can be very useful to early warning famine and
  hydrological monitoring efforts, so the Climate Hazards Group (CHG) creates forecast
  precipitation fields at the dekadal (10 day) time scale and makes those available
  to researchers and decision makers.

parameters:
- name: _type
  description: This should be one of ['mm_data','mm_anomaly','none_z-score']. mm_data
    is the CHIRPS estimates  of precipitation. The mm_anomaly provides the data value
    minus the mean of the entire time  series up to the previous year. none_z-score
    provides the Standardized Precipitation Indexes (SPI)  of the estimates.

    your region of interest.'
