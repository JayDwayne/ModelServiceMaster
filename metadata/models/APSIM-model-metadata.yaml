  description: One of 5 classes based on the mean 2018-19 cropping-year (March-February) rainfall and temperature anomalies in the climate ensemble member. Ensemble members where the root-mean-square anomaly of temperature and precipitation are within 0.9 standard deviations are "midrange"; otherwise ensemble members are classified according to the quadrant in which they fall. Null for historical runs.

    maximum: 0.08
    default: 0.0
- name: additional_extension
  description: For this scenario, an "extension package" means the adoption of both improved crop cultivars and chemical fertilizer application. The value is the proportion of land **not already using "extension package"** that is converted to management under the "extension package". For example, if 20% of maize crops in a grid-cell already use improved cultivars plus fertilizer, then 40% "additional extension package" will increase the overall level to (20% + 40% x (100%-20%)) = 52%
