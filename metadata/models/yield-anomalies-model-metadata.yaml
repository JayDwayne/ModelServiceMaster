label: Global and national yield anomalies for wheat, maize and millet based on LPJmL
description: 'We use LPJmL, a well-established dynamic global vegetation, hydrology
  and crop-growth model, to simulate wheat, maize and millet yield anomalies for 2018
  based on climate, soil conditions and management regimes. Observed weather data
  are fed into the model until April 30, 2018; afterwards, to simulate the uncertainty
  of operational forecasts, weather data is sourced from the portion May 01-Dec 31
  from the previous years (1984-2017). The crop model runs on a global grid with 0.5Â°
  size in latitude and longitude.

  We provide yield anomalies as deviation from the mean of 2013-2017 as simulated
  by LPJmL. The data is available on a global grid and as nationally aggregated anomalies.
  Apart from a default simulation, assuming the same management in 2018 as for the
  previous years, we provide alternative intervention scenarios that assume different
  irrigation levels, more nitrogen input, or both. In total, there are 3 (crops) *
  12 (scenarios) = 36 hypothetical back-casting simulations. Each of these scenarios
  is calculated for each of the 34 different 2018 climate realizations.'

- name: irrigation
  description: 'Choose the irrigation level. It should be one of [LIM, NO, POT]. NO:
    no irrigation anywhere. Crops are rain-fed only. This can be considered as a "what-if
    irrigation failed scenario".  LIM: irrigation is applied on crop-specific areas
    equipped for irrigation. Irrigation water withdrawal is limited to water available
    in surface water bodies. As a result, it is possible that irrigation demand cannot
    be fulfilled completely in some grid cells if demand is higher than supply.  POT:
    uses the same irrigated areas as LIM_IRRIGATION, but allows for withdrawals to
    exceed water available in surface water bodies. As a result, irrigated crops should
    not experience water stress.'

  description: 'Choose the nitrogen level. It should be one of [LIM, LIM_p25, LIM_p50,
    UNLIM].  LIM: country- and crop-type-specific amounts of N fertilizer to crops.
    The dataset is from GGCMI (the Global Gridded Crop Model Inter-comparison within
    AgMIP) and describes fertilizer application levels around the year 2000.  LIM_p25:
    same as LIM, but with 25% more fertilizer in all cells where N>0. That is, cells
    without fertilization around 2000 in our data set do also not receive fertilizer
    in this scenario.  LIM_p50: similar to _p25, but with 50% more N.  UNLIM: extremely
    high N rates in all cells such that there should be no N limitation of crop growth.
    There are no negative effects of too much nitrogen on plant growth in our model
    (but there will be increased leaching and outgassing).'
